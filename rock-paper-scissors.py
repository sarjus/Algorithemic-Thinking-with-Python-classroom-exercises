'''
Basic Rules:
The game has three choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
Two players (or a player and the computer) each choose one option.
The winner is determined based on the interaction of the two chosen options.
Winning Combinations:
Rock beats Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors, so Rock wins.
Scissors beats Paper: Scissors cut Paper, so Scissors win.
Paper beats Rock: Paper wraps Rock, so Paper wins.
Tie:
If both players choose the same option (e.g., Rock vs. Rock), itâ€™s a tie, and no one wins.
