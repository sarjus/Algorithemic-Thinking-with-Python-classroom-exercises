Python program to check the given number is Prime or Not
In Python, an else clause can be used with loops, not just if statements. 
This is an interesting feature, and it works a bit differently than the else 
clause you might be used to with if. Hereâ€™s how it works with a for loop in the context of this code.

How else Works with Loops
When an else is attached to a loop (for or while), the else block executes only 
if the loop completes without hitting a break statement. In other words:

If the loop completes all its iterations without break, the else block runs.
If the loop encounters a break (and therefore exits early), the else block does not run.
