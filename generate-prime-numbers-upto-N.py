Python program to Generate Prime Numbers upto N

In Python, an else clause can be used with loops, not just if statements. 
This is an interesting feature, and it works a bit differently than the else 
clause you might be used to with if. Hereâ€™s how it works with a for loop in the context of this code.

How else Works with Loops
When an else is attached to a loop (for or while), the else block executes only 
if the loop completes without hitting a break statement. In other words:

If the loop completes all its iterations without break, the else block runs.
If the loop encounters a break (and therefore exits early), the else block does not run.
